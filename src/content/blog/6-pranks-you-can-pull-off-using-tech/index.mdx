# 6 Hilarious Tech Pranks to Pull on Friends & Coworkers (Harmless & Easy)  

Looking for funny, tech-based pranks that won’t get you in trouble? From rogue cursors to fake system crashes, these 6 clever tricks use everyday tech to deliver maximum laughs—without the cleanup. Perfect for April Fools’ Day or lighthearted office shenanigans!  

## 1. The Phantom Mouse Prank  

Nothing confuses someone faster than a cursor that moves on its own. This simple script makes their mouse drift randomly, leaving them baffled.  

### How to Set It Up (Windows)  
1. Open Notepad and paste this script:  
   ```  
   MoveMouse()  
   WScript.Sleep 5000  
   Loop  
   ```  
2. Save as `ghostmouse.vbs` and run it (minimize afterward).  
3. Watch as they wrestle with their "possessed" mouse!  

**Pro Tip:** Use sparingly—this prank works best on short attention spans.  

## 2. Fake Blue Screen of Death (BSOD)  

A realistic-looking BSOD triggers instant panic, followed by relief when they realize it’s fake.  

### Steps to Fool Your Target  
- Download a BSOD image or use a full-screen webpage simulator.  
- Set it as their browser homepage or leave it open on their desktop.  
- For extra drama, add a fake countdown timer.

## 3. Autocorrect Chaos  

Subtly reprogram their device to replace normal words with absurd ones.  

### Platform-Specific Tweaks  
- **Windows:** Edit autocorrect in Word/Outlook.  
- **iPhone:** Go to *Settings > General > Keyboard > Text Replacement*.  
- **Suggestions:** Swap "meeting" with "nap time" or "boss" with "overlord."  

## 4. Never-Ending Printer Prank  

Flood a shared office printer with nonsense pages for a slow-burn gag.  

### Execute the Prank  
1. Create a document filled with lorem ipsum or random gibberish.  
2. Print it repeatedly (or use a loop command if tech-savvy).  
3. Hide nearby and enjoy the confusion as paper piles up.  

## 5. Voice Assistant Trolling  

Program Alexa or Google Home to respond oddly to everyday phrases.  

### Funny Voice Command Ideas  
- "Hey Google, turn off the lights" → *"I’m afraid I can’t do that, Dave."*  
- "Alexa, what’s the weather?" → *"Sunny with a chance of chaos."*  

## 6. Fake "Hacker" Terminal  

A scrolling command prompt looks like a Hollywood hacking scene.  

### Quick Setup  
1. Open Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac/Linux).  
2. Type `ping -t localhost` for endless network "diagnostics."  
3. For flair, add a script with fake "ACCESS DENIED" messages.
